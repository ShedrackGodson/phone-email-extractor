Say you have the boring task of finding every phone number and email
address in a long web page or document. If you manually scroll through
the page, you might end up searching for a long time. But if you had a pro-
gram that could search the text in your clipboard for phone numbers and
email addresses, you could simply press ctrl -A to select all the text, press
ctrl -C to copy it to the clipboard, and then run your program. It could
replace the text on the clipboard with just the phone numbers and email
addresses it finds.
